= Linux Kernel Module Cheat

Automatically generated historical test and benchmark results for regression analysis of https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat

Results generated as explained at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat#benchmark-this-repo

The directory names are as follows:

`<sequential-id>_<sha>`

e.g.:

`0015_2bddcc2891b7e5ac38c10d509bdfc1c8fe347b94`

`<sequential-id>` gets incremented whenever we add a new commit, and is just a convenience to keep the SHAs sorted.

Benchmarks generated with:

....
./bench-all
